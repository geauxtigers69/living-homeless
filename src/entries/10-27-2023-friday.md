# Friday - 10/27/2023

I am still developing the main functionalities of the website and i want to make sure everything works. I am testing if the markdown will render right in the journal section so Lisa and I can make posts about our day to day lives. 

Let's see if this picture shows up correctly too - if it does, I will be very satisfied.

This should be a picture of a homeless person. Did it show up? Yes - well then great! Let's celebrate!

If no - let's try again and make it work next time! Hoorah!
