# Saturday - 10/28/2023

Today started off without a bang - my back hurt when I woke up and we were both cold. But, we knew we had to get up and eat something so we scurried out of the tent to head to the Marriott to catch their continental breakfast - one of [our favorite being homeless secrets](/src/posts/homeless-secrets.md).

We then went out and took our signs that we constructed from Obama Care signs (nobody calls the number on them anyways) and stood out in the median where traffic crosses by to make some money. It worked! We made a whopping $34 to feed ourselves which isn't too shabby.

We then followed another one of our homeless secrets and grabbed water from the local pet smart so we could take a shower. Yes, it's currently the only way we have to bathe. Sometiems you gotta make due with what you don't have.

Let's see what else I have to do on this blog:

- Add Journals to the CMS
- Finish the Donations page
- Finish the resources page
- Finish the About page
- Finish the contact us form

Let's go - I hope this blog is awesome when you are reading it! Oh and Nebraska is up 14-0! Go Big Red!
