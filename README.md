# Surviving the Streets Blog 

Andrew and Lisa's blog about being homeless, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine), and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org).

This blog shares our experience through the last year of struggling and growing as humans as we have faced the most difficult challenge of our entire lives. You can find our daily diary, a timeline of events, our survival tips for the newly homeless, a newsletter sign up page, a guestbook, and a donation page for those of our readers who are so kind as to contribute to our cause that will help finance our immediate needs.

Thank you for following our journey and we hope that this blog helps those who are struggling with homelessness or have a loved one who is currently unhoused. We understand and empathize with your pain - hang in there, it is dark before the sun shines bright!
